About

Contains information provided by the Regional Municipality of Waterloo under licence.
The latest GTFS data can be found here:
http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/GRT_GTFSdata.asp

The current GRT_GTFS.zip provided in this repository contains data that is
valid from December 23 2013 to April 27 2014.

Installation
------------

grt.py uses python3 and sqlite3, and you'll need to make sure both are
installed before you can use grt.py.

To generate the database, use

	make all

Don't forget to change db_location in grt.py before you use the script!

Examples
--------

If you know the 4-digit stop id, you can use grt.py just like you would
the texting service.
	grt.py -s 2014

But if you don't, you can try going by intersection instead.
You don't need to type entire street names, and neither order nor case
matter. The following all result in the same query:
	grt.py -i university westmount
	grt.py -i uni west
	grt.py -i west uni

This is a neat trick you can use to display most buses leaving from 
Ring Road.
	grt.py -i 'u.w.' ''

Caveats
-------

grt.py currently only understands holidays when the --day flag is not
being used. GRT buses are on holiday
schedule (i.e. Sunday schedule) on the days listed here:
