grt.py uses python3 and sqlite3.

Contains information provided by the Regional Municipality of Waterloo under licence.
The latest GTFS data can be found here:

The current kwgtfs.db provided in this repository contains data that is
valid from September 2 2013 to December 22 2013.

If you want to generate a new database, unzip GRT_GTFS.zip to a
directory called data, delete kwgtfs.db and run 

	sqlite3 kwgtfs.db < create_kwgtfs.sql

Don't forget to change db_location in grt.py before you use the script!
